# Competitive landscape & roadmap

Research pass (2026-09-05, `deep-research` workflow — 102 agent calls, 20 sources, 85 claims extracted, 25
adversarially verified) comparing Banjo against other open-source projects in the same space, to answer two
questions: is Banjo differentiated enough to publish, and is there a better foundation to build on. Full
sourced report: [Banjo Gap Analysis](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/b68822b6-c23c-4a35-afc2-83552c562905).

## Verdict

Open source Banjo as-is. No surveyed project combines its five layers — swappable voice-AI + telephony
provider abstractions, contacts with cross-channel preference, a task/negotiation state machine, direct
calendar booking, and an MCP server exposing calling as a tool to an AI coding assistant. Every close analog
covers one or two of those layers, not the set.

The one real caveat: Banjo's own voice/telephony abstraction — the layer *underneath* what makes it
distinctive — is less mature than frameworks purpose-built for exactly that problem. That's a hardening item,
not a reason to hold the release. See [Roadmap](#roadmap-voicetelephony-abstraction) below.

## How Banjo compares

| Project | Covers | Missing, vs. Banjo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`dograh`](https://github.com/dograh-hq/dograh) | **The primary comparable** (added 2026-09-21). Open-source self-hostable voice-AI platform; MCP-native, BYOK across LLM/STT/TTS, 7+ telephony providers, one-command Docker self-host, visual workflow builder, hosted cloud | Not an errand-runner: no task/negotiation state machine for booking on your behalf, no contacts with cross-channel preference, no direct calendar booking. Ahead of Banjo on packaging, provider breadth and adoption |
| [`ai-dialer`](https://github.com/askjohngeorge/ai-dialer) | Outbound scheduling calls | All-in on VAPI.ai, no provider abstraction; self-disclosed demo, not production |
| [`audiocall`](https://github.com/Iamsdt/audiocall) | Twilio + Gemini Live bridge (closest architectural analog) | No contacts, task/negotiation state machine, calendar, or MCP layer |
| [`ai-calling-agent`](https://github.com/revolutionarybukhari/ai-calling-agent) | Call handling + STT/TTS | No booking, calendar, contacts, or negotiation |
| [`appointment-agent`](https://github.com/mjunaidca/appointment-agent) | LangGraph + Bland.com booking calls | Single hardcoded vendor call, no state machine; calls are confirmation-only, not live negotiation |
| [`Outbound-Real-State-Voice-AI-Agent`](https://github.com/Awaisali36/Outbound-Real-State-Voice-AI-Agent-) | Scheduled sales-lead dialing (n8n + VAPI) | Not general-purpose booking; fully SaaS-dependent |
| [`Mcp_calender_agent`](https://github.com/kristofferv98/Mcp_calender_agent) | Calendar via MCP (macOS only) | No phone-calling capability at all |

## The real gap: the abstraction layer, not the product

Generic open-source voice-AI/telephony frameworks — **Pipecat**, **LiveKit Agents**, **Vocode**, **Bolna** —
already solve the problem `src/voice/` and `src/telephony/` solve, and in places do it better:

- **Pipecat** ships maintained serializers for six telephony providers (Twilio, Telnyx, Plivo, Exotel,
  Genesys, Vonage) vs. Banjo's one (Twilio only; Gemini/ElevenLabs voice-AI adapters are still "scaffolded
  but unverified" per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`).
- **LiveKit Agents** has native SIP trunking plus its own self-hostable, Apache-licensed media server, built-in
  MCP tool support, and multi-agent handoffs.
- **Vocode** supports full DTMF and call-transfer on both Twilio and Vonage — Banjo only reaches DTMF on
  Twilio via a synthesized-audio workaround (`src/telephony/dtmf.ts`), because Twilio's WebSocket protocol has
  no signaling-level way to inject DTMF tones.
- **Bolna** and Vocode both treat outbound dialing as first-class, same as Banjo.

## Roadmap: voice/telephony abstraction

**Not swapping now.** Replacing `VoiceAIProvider`/`TelephonyProvider` means rewriting the core session engine
(`src/session/callSession.ts`, `audioPipeline.ts`) that the orchestrator, MCP tools, and contacts layer all sit
on top of — rewrite-scale risk to a path that already carries live traffic and has absorbed real-call-driven
fixes (the timezone bug, the retryable-vs-fatal error handling fix, see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s Open Risks).
Native SIP trunking and six-provider telephony coverage don't serve any need Banjo has today: Twilio + OpenAI
Realtime already works end to end for the only path carrying real traffic.

Documented candidates for if/when that changes:

- **Wrap Pipecat underneath the existing interfaces** if broader telephony-provider coverage (Telnyx, Plivo,
  Exotel, Genesys, Vonage) becomes a real requirement — e.g. a user needs a provider Twilio doesn't serve well
  in their region.
- **Wrap LiveKit Agents underneath the existing interfaces** if native SIP trunking becomes a real requirement
  — e.g. DTMF reliability against real automated IVRs (open item #5 in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`) turns out to
  need signaling-level DTMF rather than synthesized audio, or multi-provider telephony without a Twilio bridge
  becomes worth the switch.

Either is an **incremental adapter behind the current `VoiceAIProvider`/`TelephonyProvider` interfaces**, not a
rewrite of `callSession.ts` or anything above it — the abstraction boundary already exists for exactly this
reason. Revisit only when one of the trigger conditions above is real, not pre-emptively.

## Feature roadmap: two-way SMS with contacts

Today's SMS (`src/notifications/twilioSms.ts`) is one-way and owner-facing only — task-outcome summaries and
ad-hoc alerts sent *to* `NOTIFY_TO_PHONE_NUMBER`. It has no relationship to the contact being called and can't
carry a conversation. A genuinely new capability — negotiating or confirming a booking over text with the
*contact*, not the owner — would be a real differentiator: none of the surveyed projects offer a contact-facing
texting channel either (this wasn't a dedicated search target, so treat as directionally true, not verified).
Also directly useful on its own: plenty of real businesses (salons, restaurants) are text-first and don't pick
up calls from unknown numbers at all.

**Why it's not a small bolt-on:** the call path's whole shape — realtime audio, `VoiceAIProvider`'s
audio-chunk/turn-taking events, the silence/tool-call watchdogs — doesn't apply to text. A text conversation
also isn't bounded by "the call is still connected"; it can go quiet for hours between replies. This needs a
parallel, simpler orchestration path, not a mode flag inside `callSession.ts`.

What it would take, roughly in dependency order:

1. **Inbound SMS webhook.** New Hono route (analogous to Twilio's existing voice/AMD webhooks in
   `src/server.ts`) verifying Twilio's signature, parsing `From`/`Body`, and looking up the task by phone
   number + open text-conversation state.
2. **A text-session driver**, structurally much simpler than `CallSession`: no audio pipeline, no VAD race —
   just "append inbound message → run one LLM tool-calling turn → send outbound reply and/or transition task
   state." Could reuse the same Zod tool schemas from `src/voice/tools/callTools.ts` where the tool is
   content-agnostic (`confirm_appointment`, `escalate_and_end_call`-equivalents), converted through the
   existing `defineVoiceTool.ts` JSON-Schema path (or a renamed, provider-agnostic sibling) rather than
   duplicating tool definitions.
3. **New persistence**, mirroring how `call_attempts` is deliberately kept separate from a task's business
   outcome: a `text_attempts`-shaped table (message log, direction, timestamps) alongside `tasks`/`contacts` in
   `src/tasks/schema.ts` / a new `src/texting/schema.ts`. `transitionTask` (`src/tasks/service.ts`) stays the
   only writer of task status/outcome, unchanged.
4. **Orchestrator awareness.** `src/tasks/orchestrator.ts`'s state machine needs a channel dimension (phone vs.
   sms) and, since texting isn't bounded like a call, a reply-timeout that escalates or fails a task after N
   hours of silence — the existing periodic poller (already self-healing across restarts) is the natural place
   to drive this, not a new watchdog class.
5. **Contact model.** `contacts.preferredChannel` (currently online vs. phone) needs a third value, or a
   separate `acceptsSms` capability flag distinct from channel preference, since a contact could accept both a
   call and a text.
6. **MCP surface.** `placeCall` either grows a `channel` param or gets an analogous `sendText`/`startTextTask`
   tool; `getTaskStatus`/`listRecentTasks` are already channel-agnostic and need no change.

**Rough sizing:** not a quick patch — new provider-shaped abstraction, new webhook surface, new schema +
migration, and a new (if simpler) orchestration path with its own tests mirroring existing conventions
(`tests/texting/...` mocking at the interface boundary, matching `tests/session/callSession.test.ts`'s
pattern). Comparable in shape to the original inbound-calling feature (`src/inbound/`), not a few-hour addition.

## White space (lower confidence — worth leaning into, not yet confirmed as unclaimed)

- ~~**MCP-server bridge to an AI coding assistant** — no verified competing project exposes outbound calling as
  an MCP tool. Most defensible differentiator found~~ — **retracted 2026-09-21.** The caveat on this bullet
  ("an absence-of-evidence finding from a non-exhaustive search; worth a sharper, dedicated search before
  leaning on it in public-facing copy") turned out to be the operative part. Dograh is MCP-native in its own
  repo tagline and ships a Claude Code setup plugin. Do not use MCP-native as a differentiator in public copy.
- **Data-integrity model** (Postgres source of truth, server-generated idempotent confirmation keys, a
  self-healing state-machine poller) — no surveyed project's description mentions anything comparable, but this
  wasn't verified against their source, only their README-level descriptions.
- **Shared `preferredChannel` routing** between an online-booking agent and a phone-calling fallback — exactly
  the seam between Banjo and the sibling `schedule-appointment` skill. No comparable project appears to treat
  channel choice as a persistent, per-contact decision at all.

## Caveats

Several sources are vendor-comparison blogs with a possible commercial angle; this surveyed a sample of repos
and blog comparisons, not an exhaustive census (`soulee-dev/AICaller` was refuted on direct inspection —
`dograh-hq/dograh` was dismissed here too, and **that call was wrong**; see the
[2026-09-21 correction](#2026-09-21-correction-dograh-is-the-primary-comparable)). The space
moved fast through 2025–2026, so any framework-capability claim here has a shelf life of months. "Has the
feature" was verified — not "the feature works well at scale," license compatibility, or community health.

# 2026-09-17 update: ElevenLabs Reception

ElevenLabs announced [Reception](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/reception) (reception.ai) on **2026-09-16** — a
packaged vertical SaaS AI receptionist built on ElevenAgents, aimed at small businesses (home services,
salons, clinics, real estate, property management). This section records what it actually ships and where it
does and doesn't touch Banjo.

Sources: [product page](https://elevenlabs.io/reception), [launch post](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/reception),
[docs overview](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/reception-ai/overview),
[receptionist capabilities](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/reception-ai/receptionist/overview),

[inbox](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/reception-ai/features/inbox),
[knowledge base](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/reception-ai/knowledge-base/overview).

## What Reception ships

| Area | Capability |
| --- | --- |
| Direction | **Inbound only.** No outbound calling or automated callbacks appear anywhere in the docs. |
| Onboarding | Point it at your website; it scrapes services, hours, team and location into a knowledge base. Claimed sub-5-minute setup. |
| Calls | 24/7 answering, personalized greetings, 70+ languages with automatic mid-call language detection, 2,000+ voices |
| Booking | Four-way resource model — services x staff x assets (rooms/equipment) x availability. Multi-location with per-location hours and staff. Time-off blocking. Google Calendar sync. |
| Channels | Phone + web chat + public self-serve booking page, all backed by one agent |
| Transfers | Up to 10 intent-routed transfer rules per receptionist |
| Messages | Takes messages with priority levels; **texts an SMS confirmation to the caller** |
| Inbox | Every call stored with transcript, metadata, outcome summary; voicemails; and *knowledge gaps* (questions the agent couldn't answer) |
| CRM | Auto-built client profiles with interaction history |
| Analytics | Performance and revenue tracking |
| Integrations | Google Calendar, Zapier (all paid tiers), webhooks (Plus/Premium) |
| Scale | Multiple receptionists per account on higher tiers (per department, location or language) |
| Pricing | $29 / 75 min / 1 concurrent call; $79 / 275 min / 3; $199 / 1,000 min / 10. Overage $0.45 -> $0.30/min. |
| Stated gaps | No HIPAA compliance. No outbound. No self-hosting or multi-tenant deployment. |

## The framing: these are near-inverse products

Reception answers calls *for a business*. Banjo places calls *for a person*. Reception has no outbound
capability at all, which means Banjo's entire primary path (`place_call` -> negotiate -> confirm -> notify,
plus AMD-driven voicemail, DTMF, and scheduled calls) has **zero overlap** with it.

The overlap is exactly one module: `src/inbound/`, still gated off behind `INBOUND_BOOKING_ENABLED`. That's
where this analysis has teeth, and everything below is scoped to it.

**Strategic stance: not a race.** Banjo isn't trying to beat Reception on features or price — a funded vendor
will always win a packaged-SMB-SaaS feature race. The goal is to be the version companies and individuals can
read, self-host, and fork into their own. Capability gaps matter only where they stop someone from building
their own Reception on top of Banjo; they don't matter as scorecard entries.

## Where Reception is ahead (all of it inbound)

| Capability | Reception | Banjo | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Knowledge base | Website-scraped, automatic | none | `src/inbound/systemPrompt.ts` is a static prompt. No business-facts store. |
| Booking resource model | services x staff x assets x locations | single calendar, single duration | `INBOUND_DEFAULT_DURATION_MINUTES` + one `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`. |
| Business hours | per-location, per-staff, time-off | one global window | `src/inbound/businessHours.ts` is a single rectangle — no holidays or exceptions. |
| Call transfer | 10 intent-based rules | none | Banjo's only escape hatch is `flag_for_owner_and_end_call` — hang up and notify. |
| Caller-facing SMS | confirmation texted to caller | none | Banjo's SMS is one-way, owner-facing only (`NOTIFY_TO_PHONE_NUMBER`). See the two-way SMS roadmap item above. |
| Transcripts / recordings | stored, searchable inbox | none | `LOG_TRANSCRIPTS` writes to logs only. No transcript column in `tasks`, `call_attempts` or `inbound_calls`. |
| Knowledge-gap capture | logs unanswered questions for review | none | Cheap to copy and genuinely useful. |
| Language auto-detect | 70+, switches mid-call | provider default, unconfigured | |
| Web chat + booking page | yes | none | Banjo is phone-only. |
| Analytics / CRM history | dashboard, revenue tracking | none | Banjo has no UI; `listRecentTasks` over MCP is the entire reporting surface. |
| Multi-agent / multi-tenant | multiple receptionists | single-tenant | Deliberate design choice, not a defect. |

## Where Banjo is ahead

1. **Outbound calling, full stop.** The negotiation state machine, AMD-driven voicemail, DTMF against IVRs,
   and scheduled calls with compare-and-set claiming. Not a feature flag away for Reception — a different
   product.
2. **MCP surface.** Nine tools exposed to an AI coding assistant. Reception offers Zapier and webhooks;
   nothing agent-native.
3. **Vendor-swappable voice AI.** Four adapters behind one interface; Reception is ElevenLabs-locked by
   construction.
4. **Data-integrity model.** Postgres as source of truth, server-generated idempotency keys from
   `callAttemptId`, `transitionTask` as sole status writer with terminal-status refusal, self-healing poller.
5. **Timezone discipline.** `zonedTimeToUtcIso()` enforced on every calendar-write path.
6. **Self-hosting and data ownership.** Your Twilio, your calendar, your Postgres, MIT-licensed. Reception has
   no HIPAA story; a self-hosted instance makes that a conversation you control.
7. **Cross-channel contact routing.** `contacts.preferredChannel` persisting the online-vs-phone decision
   across the skill and the call path.

## What's worth taking

Three cheap, high-leverage items, all landing in `src/inbound/`, none touching `callSession.ts`:

1. **Persist transcripts + outcome summaries.** Every provider adapter already emits `transcript` events that
   currently go only to the logger. A table keyed to `call_attempts`/`inbound_calls` is a schema change plus a
   write, and it unblocks everything else here. Highest value per line of code in the repo today.
2. **Knowledge-gap logging.** When the inbound agent can't answer, record the question rather than only
   flagging the owner. Nearly free given #1.
3. **Caller-facing SMS confirmation.** A deliberate narrowing of the two-way-SMS roadmap item above: one-way
   "you're booked for X" to the *caller* after `book_appointment` needs no inbound webhook, no text-session
   driver, and no message-log schema — roughly 10% of that item's cost for most of its perceived value.

Explicitly **not** chasing: the services/staff/assets resource model and the analytics dashboard. Both are
SMB-business features. Banjo is a single-person assistant; building a staff scheduler into it means chasing
Reception into a market it has already packaged and priced for. If a forker needs that, the right answer is
that the seams let them build it — not that Banjo ships it.

## Pricing note

$29/month for 75 minutes resets the floor of this category. It doesn't threaten Banjo's outbound path, but it
does mean the inbound booking line has to justify itself on ownership and integration (your data, your
calendar, MCP-native, agent-controllable) rather than on capability or cost — at 75 min/month, self-hosting is
not obviously cheaper once realtime audio tokens are counted alongside Twilio minutes.

# 2026-09-21 correction: Dograh is the primary comparable

The 2026-09-05 pass listed [`dograh-hq/dograh`](https://github.com/dograh-hq/dograh) among "exciting-sounding
direct competitor candidates" that "were refuted on direct inspection." **That was wrong.** Verified live via
the GitHub API on 2026-09-21: 5,692 stars, 1,423 forks, BSD-2-Clause, pushed that day. Its own repo
description reads "Open source voice AI platform. Self-hosted alternative to Vapi and Retell. On Prem, BYOK
across Speech to Speech or LLM/STT/TTS, with a visual workflow builder, MCP native and telephony support."
It was #1 Product of the Day, Week and Month on Product Hunt, self-hosts via a single `curl` + start script,
and ships an official Claude Code plugin so a coding agent can install it.

## What this changes

- **"MCP-native" is not a differentiator.** Retracted above in [White space](#white-space-lower-confidence--worth-leaning-into-not-yet-confirmed-as-unclaimed).
  Dograh is MCP-native and better packaged. Do not put it in public-facing copy as a wedge.
- **"Open-source self-hostable vendor-swappable voice AI" is taken**, by a project with a year's head start,
  a hosted-cloud revenue line, and a deployment story Banjo does not currently match.
- **The Verdict's five-layer claim still holds, but for a narrower reason than stated.** Dograh has the
  provider abstractions and the MCP surface; it does not have the task/negotiation state machine, contacts
  with cross-channel preference, or direct calendar booking. The differentiator is the *errand-running
  assistant*, not the voice/telephony plumbing.
- **Positioning implication:** Banjo is an AI assistant that makes your phone calls for you, that you run
  yourself — an errand-runner, not a receptionist and not a voice-agent platform. Reception answers calls for
  a business; Dograh is a platform for building business voice agents; Banjo places calls for a person.

exposure on the outbound path, and an explicit list of refuted and unverified claims:
[Banjo vs Reception — Strategy](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/a050344f-b407-4496-8531-56b86885a117).

**Method note.** The deep-research harness's adversarial verification stage did not complete (session limits);
3 claims reached a full 3-0 vote, 4 were refuted, 18 were extracted but never voted on. The decisive sources
above were opened and verified directly instead. One refuted item to avoid repeating anywhere: the
"16% of failed projects had contributing guidelines vs 72% of top projects / 27% vs 68% for CI" statistic did
not survive verification against its cited source.
